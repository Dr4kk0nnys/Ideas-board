# Ideas-board
This program will have a front and back end. Running an api on the backend, and a simple, but pretty frontend.

# The api
The api behind the project will be running typescript. The idea is to have a simple api with a simple database.  
The api will in it's core be running typescript with express.  
The database will be a simple .txt file, but there's a plan to upgrade to mongodb.
